Box 2935Albany ,  NY 12220 - 0935  The State Department of Motor Vehicles Traffic Violations Bureaus handle parking tickets or violations by pedestrians.  These are usually handled by a local parking violations bureau or court.  The most common reasons your license may be suspended or revoked due to motor vehicle violations follow.  Remember ,  your license also will be suspended if you do not answer a ticket or pay a fine.  An ALJ has the authority to suspend or revoke your license for violations other than those listed.  Speeding / Misdemeanors If you commit three speeding and/or misdemeanor traffic violations within 18 months ,  your license will be revoked for at least six months.  New Driver Probation You are on license probation for six months after you pass a road test.  If you are found guilty of committing any two moving violations during your probation period ,  your license will be suspended for 60 days.  It will also be suspended for 60 days if you are found guilty of committing a single, more serious violation during the probation period, including speeding, tailgating, unauthorized racing or reckless driving.  For violations committed on or after November 1 , 2014 - If you are found guilty of committing a texting / cell phone violation during the probation period ,  your license will be suspended for 120 days.  For texting / cell phone violations committed between July 1 , 2013 and October 31 , 2014, your probationary license will be suspended for 60 days.  If you are a holder of a probationary / junior license or learner permit and you are charged with a cell phone / texting violation on or after July 1 , 2013 ,  you cannot plead by mail or online.  You must appear for a hearing in a TVB office.  Points Most traffic violations carry violation points.  The points will be added to your record using the date the violation occurred, not the date you are found guilty.  If your violation points in any 18-month period add up to 11 or more ,  your license may be revoked or suspended following a hearing.  The ALJ usually holds the point hearing immediately after you are found guilty of a violation that brings your total to 11 or more points in 18 months.  On the following panel is a list of common violations and the number of points for each.  Taking a DMV - approved accident prevention course can reduce your point total by up to four points and reduce your auto liability and collision insurance premiums by 10% for three years.

There are 6 general ways you can try to avoid a foreclosure :  Repayment plan :  If you ve missed a few mortgage payments ,  this plan lets you go back to making your regular payments, with an added amount each month to cover the ones you ve missed.  Special forbearance :  This plan gives you some extra time to repay the missed mortgage payments.  Loan modification :  Sometimes you need a fresh start.  This plan lets you add the missed mortgage payments and any related legal costs to your total loan balance.  You and your servicer then come up with a new mortgage payment schedule.  Extra time to arrange a private sale :  If you need to sell your home, this plan lets you delay a foreclosure so you have time to sell.  Short sale :  If you owe more money than your house is worth ,  your servicer might agree to a short sale.  This means the servicer will accept the total proceeds from the home sale even if it s less than the full amount you owe on the mortgage as full payment of the debt you owe.  Deed in lieu of foreclosure :  This plan lets you avoid the foreclosure process by signing over the deed to the home to your servicer.  The home will then belong to the servicer.  Our VA Loan Technicians can help you figure out which option is best for you.  Contact a VA Loan Technician at 1 - 877 - 827 - 3702."

There are 6 general ways you can try to avoid a foreclosure :  Repayment plan :  If you ve missed a few mortgage payments ,  this plan lets you go back to making your regular payments, with an added amount each month to cover the ones you ve missed.  Special forbearance :  This plan gives you some extra time to repay the missed mortgage payments.  Loan modification :  Sometimes you need a fresh start.  This plan lets you add the missed mortgage payments and any related legal costs to your total loan balance.  You and your servicer then come up with a new mortgage payment schedule.  Extra time to arrange a private sale :  If you need to sell your home, this plan lets you delay a foreclosure so you have time to sell.  Short sale :  If you owe more money than your house is worth ,  your servicer might agree to a short sale.  This means the servicer will accept the total proceeds from the home sale even if it s less than the full amount you owe on the mortgage as full payment of the debt you owe.  Deed in lieu of foreclosure :  This plan lets you avoid the foreclosure process by signing over the deed to the home to your servicer.  The home will then belong to the servicer.  Our VA Loan Technicians can help you figure out which option is best for you.  Contact a VA Loan Technician at 1 - 877 - 827 - 3702."

About half the complaints received by DMV are resolved through mediation . If the repair problem isn't resolved ,  your complaint will often be referred to a DMV regional office for investigation.  A DMV inspector may contact you to ask questions or discuss your case in detail.  These inspectors are experienced automotive technicians trained to investigate and resolve complaints . If the DMV investigation indicates the shop violated the Repair Shop Act or regulations, DMV will either send a warning letter to the shop or schedule a hearing.  If a hearing determines there were violations ,  DMV will take action against the shop.  This may include suspending or revoking the shop's registration and/or imposing fines . If you suffer a financial loss due to overcharging or unnecessary or poor quality repairs, the administrative law judge presiding at the hearing may offer the shop the option of paying restitution.  The shop may then receive a shorter suspension period and/or a lower fine . DMV cannot force a shop to pay restitution.  Restitution is limited to the amount you were overcharged or the cost of proper repairs.  Other expenses, such as the cost of renting a replacement car, cannot be included.  Filing a complaint with DMV does not prevent you from seeking help from other consumer protection agencies or from taking the shop to court.  However ,  if you receive a court settlement or one is pending ,  restitution through DMV is not available."

These are usually handled by a local parking violations bureau or court.  The most common reasons your license may be suspended or revoked due to motor vehicle violations follow.  Remember ,  your license also will be suspended if you do not answer a ticket or pay a fine.  An ALJ has the authority to suspend or revoke your license for violations other than those listed.  Speeding / Misdemeanors If you commit three speeding and/or misdemeanor traffic violations within 18 months ,  your license will be revoked for at least six months.  New Driver Probation You are on license probation for six months after you pass a road test.  If you are found guilty of committing any two moving violations during your probation period ,  your license will be suspended for 60 days.  It will also be suspended for 60 days if you are found guilty of committing a single, more serious violation during the probation period, including speeding, tailgating, unauthorized racing or reckless driving.  For violations committed on or after November 1 , 2014 - If you are found guilty of committing a texting / cell phone violation during the probation period ,  your license will be suspended for 120 days.  For texting / cell phone violations committed between July 1 , 2013 and October 31 , 2014, your probationary license will be suspended for 60 days.  If you are a holder of a probationary / junior license or learner permit and you are charged with a cell phone / texting violation on or after July 1 , 2013 ,  you cannot plead by mail or online.  You must appear for a hearing in a TVB office.  Points Most traffic violations carry violation points.  The points will be added to your record using the date the violation occurred, not the date you are found guilty.  If your violation points in any 18-month period add up to 11 or more ,  your license may be revoked or suspended following a hearing.  The ALJ usually holds the point hearing immediately after you are found guilty of a violation that brings your total to 11 or more points in 18 months.  On the following panel is a list of common violations and the number of points for each.  Taking a DMV - approved accident prevention course can reduce your point total by up to four points and reduce your auto liability and collision insurance premiums by 10% for three years.

                "text": "Total and Permanent Disability Discharge | Federal Student Aid //   If my loan is discharged due to TPD, do I have to pay taxes on the discharged loan amount?   Because of a change in federal law related to the taxability of loan amounts discharged due to TPD ,  the answer depends on when you received the discharge.  If you received a TPD discharge of a loan before Jan. 1 , 2018 ,  the loan amount discharged may be considered income for federal tax purposes under Internal Revenue Service IRS rules.  If you received a TPD discharge of a loan during the period from Jan. 1 , 2018 to Dec. 31 , 2025 ,  the discharged loan amount won t be considered income for federal tax purposes.  For purposes of determining whether a loan amount discharged due to TPD may be treated as taxable income for federal tax purposes ,  the date you are considered to have received the discharge is different depending on how you qualified for the discharge.  If you re a veteran who showed that you re totally and permanently disabled based on a disability determination by the VA ,  you re considered to have received the discharge for federal tax purposes on the date we approve the discharge.  If you showed that you re totally and permanently disabled based on documentation from the SSA or a physician s certification meaning that you re subject to a three - year postdischarge monitoring period ,  you re considered to have received the discharge for federal tax purposes at the end of the postdischarge monitoring period.  For example ,  if your discharge was approved in July 2017 ,  you would not be considered to have received the discharge for federal tax purposes until July 2020, at the end of the three - year postdischarge monitoring period.  Therefore ,  the IRS would not consider the discharged loan amount to be taxable income for federal tax purposes.  If you receive a Form 1099-C, you should keep the form for your records ,  but you do not need to include it when filing your federal tax return.  For additional information ,  visit irs.gov.  Loan amounts discharged due to TPD may still be considered income for state tax purposes.  If you receive a TPD discharge of a federal student loan ,  you may want to consult with your state tax office or a tax professional before you file your state tax return."

If the inquiry letter does not resolve the problem ,  we must suspend the vehicle registration and ,  if it persists, your driver license!We suspend 300,000 registrations a year for failure to maintain insurance.  If you fail to maintain an updated address with us ,  you won t learn that you have an insurance problem ,  and we will suspend your registration and license.  Make sure you turn in your vehicle s license plates at DMV before you cancel your insurance policy.  Insurance policies must be from a company licensed in New York State.

About half the complaints received by DMV are resolved through mediation . If the repair problem isn't resolved ,  your complaint will often be referred to a DMV regional office for investigation.  A DMV inspector may contact you to ask questions or discuss your case in detail.  These inspectors are experienced automotive technicians trained to investigate and resolve complaints . If the DMV investigation indicates the shop violated the Repair Shop Act or regulations, DMV will either send a warning letter to the shop or schedule a hearing.  If a hearing determines there were violations ,  DMV will take action against the shop.  This may include suspending or revoking the shop's registration and/or imposing fines . If you suffer a financial loss due to overcharging or unnecessary or poor quality repairs, the administrative law judge presiding at the hearing may offer the shop the option of paying restitution.  The shop may then receive a shorter suspension period and/or a lower fine . DMV cannot force a shop to pay restitution.  Restitution is limited to the amount you were overcharged or the cost of proper repairs.  Other expenses, such as the cost of renting a replacement car, cannot be included.  Filing a complaint with DMV does not prevent you from seeking help from other consumer protection agencies or from taking the shop to court.  However ,  if you receive a court settlement or one is pending ,  restitution through DMV is not available."

The DPPA was enacted by Congress after a careful debate about why states should be allowed to share DMV data.  The DPPA prohibits states from disclosing a driver s personal information to anyone who does not have what the DPPA considers a permissible use.  The DPPA defines personal information as an individual s photograph, social security number, driver identification number, name, address, telephone number and medical information.

If there are registrations in your name that are not shown ,  you can enter the plate or registration number to add them to the list and change the address for those registrations.  If you select \" No Change \" for any photo documents or registrations on your change address list ,  the new address you enter for other DMV records will not apply to those records.  If you want to change the address for those records to a different new address ,  then you must process a separate address change and select only the records to which that address will be applied.  If a driver license, non - driver ID or registration on your change of address list is eligible to be renewed ,  the expiration date appears in bold red text on the Confirmation Page after you process the address change.  You can then go online to renew your photo driver license or non - driver photo ID card [9], renew vehicle registration [10] or renew boat registrations [10] and receive documents with your new address displayed.  After your address change is processed ,  links are provided to order replacement duplicate documents that show your new address.  There are fees to order the replacement documents."

There are 6 general ways you can try to avoid a foreclosure :  Repayment plan :  If you ve missed a few mortgage payments ,  this plan lets you go back to making your regular payments, with an added amount each month to cover the ones you ve missed.  Special forbearance :  This plan gives you some extra time to repay the missed mortgage payments.  Loan modification :  Sometimes you need a fresh start.  This plan lets you add the missed mortgage payments and any related legal costs to your total loan balance.  You and your servicer then come up with a new mortgage payment schedule.  Extra time to arrange a private sale :  If you need to sell your home, this plan lets you delay a foreclosure so you have time to sell.  Short sale :  If you owe more money than your house is worth ,  your servicer might agree to a short sale.  This means the servicer will accept the total proceeds from the home sale even if it s less than the full amount you owe on the mortgage as full payment of the debt you owe.  Deed in lieu of foreclosure :  This plan lets you avoid the foreclosure process by signing over the deed to the home to your servicer.  The home will then belong to the servicer.  Our VA Loan Technicians can help you figure out which option is best for you.  Contact a VA Loan Technician at 1 - 877 - 827 - 3702."

Better yet ,  don t visit a DMV office at all, and see if your transaction can be performed online, like an address change, registration renewal, license renewal, replacing a lost title, paying a DRA or scheduling a road test.  Our award - winning website is recognized as one of the best in the nation.  It has all the answers you need to efficiently perform any DMV transaction.

A DMV inspector may contact you to ask questions or discuss your case in detail.  These inspectors are experienced automotive technicians trained to investigate and resolve complaints . If the DMV investigation indicates the shop violated the Repair Shop Act or regulations, DMV will either send a warning letter to the shop or schedule a hearing.  If a hearing determines there were violations ,  DMV will take action against the shop.  This may include suspending or revoking the shop's registration and/or imposing fines . If you suffer a financial loss due to overcharging or unnecessary or poor quality repairs, the administrative law judge presiding at the hearing may offer the shop the option of paying restitution.  The shop may then receive a shorter suspension period and/or a lower fine . DMV cannot force a shop to pay restitution.  Restitution is limited to the amount you were overcharged or the cost of proper repairs.  Other expenses, such as the cost of renting a replacement car, cannot be included.  Filing a complaint with DMV does not prevent you from seeking help from other consumer protection agencies or from taking the shop to court.

The ALJ will listen to sworn testimony from the police officer, who will explain why you were given the ticket.  Then ,  you or your attorney may ask the officer questions.  You also may bring witnesses to testify for you and written evidence.  The judge may ask witnesses questions to better understand their testimony.  You do not have to testify but you may if you wish.  You cannot be found guilty just because you do not testify.  When all of the evidence and testimony have been given ,  the ALJ will decide whether or not you are guilty.  That decision will be based only on the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing and what the law states.  If the ALJ decides the charge against you was not proven by clear and convincing evidence ,  you will be found not guilty.  If the charge is proven and you are found guilty ,  the judge will set a fine.  Your license or registration also may be suspended or revoked, depending on the violation and your overall driving record."

The $300 DRA fee can be paid in $100 annual installments over three years.  Motorists who fail to maintain an updated address with DMV may resolve their tickets with the court, but never receive their DRA assessment because we do not have their new address on record.

                "text": "Know Your Rights in Auto Repair //   What Happens to Your Complaint   A DMV customer service representative will try to resolve the problem by discussing it with you and the shop.  About half the complaints received by DMV are resolved through mediation . If the repair problem isn't resolved ,  your complaint will often be referred to a DMV regional office for investigation.  A DMV inspector may contact you to ask questions or discuss your case in detail.  These inspectors are experienced automotive technicians trained to investigate and resolve complaints . If the DMV investigation indicates the shop violated the Repair Shop Act or regulations, DMV will either send a warning letter to the shop or schedule a hearing.  If a hearing determines there were violations ,  DMV will take action against the shop.  This may include suspending or revoking the shop's registration and/or imposing fines . If you suffer a financial loss due to overcharging or unnecessary or poor quality repairs, the administrative law judge presiding at the hearing may offer the shop the option of paying restitution.  The shop may then receive a shorter suspension period and/or a lower fine . DMV cannot force a shop to pay restitution.  Restitution is limited to the amount you were overcharged or the cost of proper repairs.  Other expenses, such as the cost of renting a replacement car, cannot be included.  Filing a complaint with DMV does not prevent you from seeking help from other consumer protection agencies or from taking the shop to court.  However ,  if you receive a court settlement or one is pending ,  restitution through DMV is not available."
