However ,  there are disadvantages.  A private seller does not have to follow important regulations that a dealer must obey.  In addition ,  a private seller rarely offers a warranty.  If you have a complaint about the vehicle or purchase ,  you are on your own to resolve the problem with the seller, or in taking legal action.  You cannot file a complaint with the DMV or other consumer assistance agencies if you buy a defective vehicle in a private sale.  If you buy a vehicle 8 model years old or newer ,  the DMV will NOT register or issue you a new title certificate unless the seller has completed, and you have signed, the damage disclosure statement on the reverse of the vehicle's Certificate of Title MV-999 or have attached a completed damage disclosure on an Odometer and Damage Disclosure Statement MV-103.  This statement indicates whether or not the vehicle's new title certificate should be branded \" Rebuilt Salvage \" see Title Branding.  An Odometer and Damage Disclosure Statement pdf [2] MV-103 is available at any motor vehicle office.  For motor vehicles that are 10 model years old or newer ,  the seller must complete the odometer disclosure statement on the back of the title certificate.  For vehicles older than 10 model years ,  odometer disclosure is not required.  The damage disclosure statement on the back of the title certificate must be completed regardless of the vehicle s age.

Carefully examine the current owner's Certificate of Title MV-999 you buy.  Be sure the information is correct ,  and that the title certificate identifies the motor vehicle, motorboat, or manufactured home being sold.  Compare the vehicle identification number VIN on the title with the actual VIN.  A motorboat's VIN is located on its hull ,  and a manufactured home's VIN is stamped on its chassis.  A motor vehicle's VIN is usually located on the driver's side dashboard, near the windshield :  For a motor vehicle 10 years old and newer ,  be sure the odometer reading, your name and address as buyer, and the date are printed clearly in the spaces provided under \" TRANSFER BY OWNER \" on the reverse of the title.  If the odometer reading is not available on the title ,  you must obtain a completed Odometer And Damage Disclosure Statement PDF [10] MV-103 from the seller.  Sign as indicated on the appropriate place on the title certificate or on the MV-103 to acknowledge you have seen the reported mileage.  For a motor vehicle 8 years old or newer ,  be sure the seller has completed the appropriate damage disclosure statement.  This statement indicates whether or not the vehicle's new title certificate should be branded \" Rebuilt Salvage.  \"  The damage disclosure statement is printed on the reverse of title certificates issued beginning 1994.  If an older version of the title is used ,  the seller must give you a completed Odometer And Disclosure Statement MV-103, available at any motor vehicle office.

If the seller indicates the vehicle has been damaged to the extent that the cost of repairs would be in excess of 75 percent of the retail value of the vehicle at the time of loss ,  the vehicle cannot be registered.  It must undergo a salvage vehicle examination by DMV.  After the vehicle passes the exam ,  the DMV will issue a branded title.  PLEASE NOTE:  If the vehicle is 8 model years old or newer ,  the DMV will NOT register your motor vehicle or issue you a new title certificate unless the seller has completed, and you have signed, the damage disclosure statement on the reverse of the vehicle's Certificate of Title MV-999 or attached a completed damage disclosure on an Odometer And Damage Disclosure Statement MV-103.

If a lienholder is listed on the front of the title ,  be sure the seller gives you the original proof of lien release before you complete the purchase.  Otherwise, you may become responsible for the lien ,  and your purchase could be repossessed for non - payment.  As the new owner ,  you will need proof of the purchase price for sales tax purposes--have the seller fill out the appropriate NYS vehicle sales tax form, most often the \" Affidavit of Sale / Statement of Transaction \" DTF-802 available at any motor vehicle office, by request from a DMV Call Center or from the DMV Internet Office.

Make sure there's a green and white \" Registered State of New York Motor Vehicle Repair Shop \" sign outside the shop and a valid New York State Department of Motor Vehicles DMV registration certificate inside.  Use the \" Find a DMV - regulated Business \" service to find a registered repair shop in your area.  Ask your family, friends and co - workers for advice on reliable repair shops in your area, as well as those you should avoid.  Keep all records, including estimates, invoices, work orders, receipts, guarantees and warranties.  Besides their importance in case you file a repair complaint ,  these papers serve as your record of service, and could increase your vehicle's resale value.  If you authorize repair work by phone ,  write down the date and time, the name of the person you spoke with, any estimated price quoted, and other pertinent details.  Don't be afraid to ask questions.  Management of a shop should take the time to explain required repairs and prices, discuss problems, and tell you about the training and experience of employees."

Remember ,  your license also will be suspended if you do not answer a ticket or pay a fine.  An ALJ has the authority to suspend or revoke your license for violations other than those listed.  Speeding / Misdemeanors If you commit three speeding and/or misdemeanor traffic violations within 18 months ,  your license will be revoked for at least six months.  New Driver Probation You are on license probation for six months after you pass a road test.  If you are found guilty of committing any two moving violations during your probation period ,  your license will be suspended for 60 days.  It will also be suspended for 60 days if you are found guilty of committing a single, more serious violation during the probation period, including speeding, tailgating, unauthorized racing or reckless driving.

The points will be added to your record using the date the violation occurred, not the date you are found guilty.  If your violation points in any 18-month period add up to 11 or more ,  your license may be revoked or suspended following a hearing.  The ALJ usually holds the point hearing immediately after you are found guilty of a violation that brings your total to 11 or more points in 18 months.  On the following panel is a list of common violations and the number of points for each.  Taking a DMV - approved accident prevention course can reduce your point total by up to four points and reduce your auto liability and collision insurance premiums by 10% for three years.

This allows courts in these areas to concentrate on criminal cases, including driving offenses, such as driving while intoxicated and driving while suspended or revoked aggravated unlicensed operation.  However ,  TVBs do not handle parking violations.  If you plead not guilty to a traffic ticket in one of these TVB areas ,  your case will be heard by a DMV Administrative Law Judge ALJ, an experienced attorney with special training in the Vehicle and Traffic Law.  An ALJ has the authority to decide whether or not you are guilty and to set a fine if you are found guilty.  An ALJ also has the authority to revoke or suspend your driver license and/or auto registration when required by law or when the ALJ believes it is in the interest of traffic safety.  Just as in traffic courts in other areas of the state ,  you may present witnesses and evidence at a hearing before an ALJ and be represented by an attorney."

Often ,  motorists convicted of a traffic ticket feel they have resolved all their motoring issues with the local court, but later learn that the Driver Responsibility Assessment DRA is a separate DMV charge based on the total points they accumulate.  The $300 DRA fee can be paid in $100 annual installments over three years.  Motorists who fail to maintain an updated address with DMV may resolve their tickets with the court, but never receive their DRA assessment because we do not have their new address on record.  Failure to pay the DRA will result in a suspended license.  Learn more about About the NYS Driver Point System [4] and how to Pay Driver Responsibility Assessment [5 ]"

These are usually handled by a local parking violations bureau or court.  The most common reasons your license may be suspended or revoked due to motor vehicle violations follow.  Remember ,  your license also will be suspended if you do not answer a ticket or pay a fine.  An ALJ has the authority to suspend or revoke your license for violations other than those listed.  Speeding / Misdemeanors If you commit three speeding and/or misdemeanor traffic violations within 18 months ,  your license will be revoked for at least six months.  New Driver Probation You are on license probation for six months after you pass a road test.  If you are found guilty of committing any two moving violations during your probation period ,  your license will be suspended for 60 days.  It will also be suspended for 60 days if you are found guilty of committing a single, more serious violation during the probation period, including speeding, tailgating, unauthorized racing or reckless driving.  For violations committed on or after November 1 , 2014 - If you are found guilty of committing a texting / cell phone violation during the probation period ,  your license will be suspended for 120 days.  For texting / cell phone violations committed between July 1 , 2013 and October 31 , 2014, your probationary license will be suspended for 60 days.  If you are a holder of a probationary / junior license or learner permit and you are charged with a cell phone / texting violation on or after July 1 , 2013 ,  you cannot plead by mail or online.  You must appear for a hearing in a TVB office.  Points Most traffic violations carry violation points.  The points will be added to your record using the date the violation occurred, not the date you are found guilty.  If your violation points in any 18-month period add up to 11 or more ,  your license may be revoked or suspended following a hearing.  The ALJ usually holds the point hearing immediately after you are found guilty of a violation that brings your total to 11 or more points in 18 months.  On the following panel is a list of common violations and the number of points for each.  Taking a DMV - approved accident prevention course can reduce your point total by up to four points and reduce your auto liability and collision insurance premiums by 10% for three years.

These are usually handled by a local parking violations bureau or court.  The most common reasons your license may be suspended or revoked due to motor vehicle violations follow.  Remember ,  your license also will be suspended if you do not answer a ticket or pay a fine.  An ALJ has the authority to suspend or revoke your license for violations other than those listed.  Speeding / Misdemeanors If you commit three speeding and/or misdemeanor traffic violations within 18 months ,  your license will be revoked for at least six months.  New Driver Probation You are on license probation for six months after you pass a road test.  If you are found guilty of committing any two moving violations during your probation period ,  your license will be suspended for 60 days.  It will also be suspended for 60 days if you are found guilty of committing a single, more serious violation during the probation period, including speeding, tailgating, unauthorized racing or reckless driving.  For violations committed on or after November 1 , 2014 - If you are found guilty of committing a texting / cell phone violation during the probation period ,  your license will be suspended for 120 days.  For texting / cell phone violations committed between July 1 , 2013 and October 31 , 2014, your probationary license will be suspended for 60 days.  If you are a holder of a probationary / junior license or learner permit and you are charged with a cell phone / texting violation on or after July 1 , 2013 ,  you cannot plead by mail or online.  You must appear for a hearing in a TVB office.  Points Most traffic violations carry violation points.  The points will be added to your record using the date the violation occurred, not the date you are found guilty.  If your violation points in any 18-month period add up to 11 or more ,  your license may be revoked or suspended following a hearing.  The ALJ usually holds the point hearing immediately after you are found guilty of a violation that brings your total to 11 or more points in 18 months.  On the following panel is a list of common violations and the number of points for each.  Taking a DMV - approved accident prevention course can reduce your point total by up to four points and reduce your auto liability and collision insurance premiums by 10% for three years.  Ask for more information at any motor vehicle office."

When you file ,  you ll have to provide evidence supporting documents like a doctor s report or medical test results showing that your disability prevents you from holding down a steady job.  We ll also review your work and education history.  Example :  A Veteran has a service - connected heart condition and a 60% disability rating.  She was still able to work until last year when she began to get chest pain when doing anything physical, like walking or lifting boxes.  Her doctor told her to retire as soon as possible.

In order to register for a account ,  you must first select a Sign - In Username and Password and provide your identity information.  Your Username, Password, and identity information are stored in a secure directory called the NY.gov, which is maintained by New York State Office of Information Technology Services.  Username and Password  When you register for a account ,  you will be sent a temporary password by email.  You must use the temporary password to complete the on - line registration process.  After completing your registration ,  you can use your permanent Sign - In Username and Password for gaining access to applications and services.  Upon validation of your identity ,  you will be permitted access to use DMV's secure web applications.  This process is designed to protect the security of your identifying personal information.  Your Sign - In Username and Password, and identifying personal information will be used solely for the purpose of NY.gov.  As an additional feature of NY.gov you can use the same Username and Password when you register to use secure web applications available at other New York State agencies that participate in NY.gov.  After registering to gain access to use secure web applications at another NYS agency ,  you simply sign in using the same Username and Password.  Deactivation of NY.gov and Accounts  For security purposes ,  the use of your MyDMV account is dependent upon validation of your identity by NY.gov.  In the event that NY.gov deactivates access for any reason e.g., unable to validate your identity ,  your account will also be deactivated ,  and thereafter access to applications and on - line services will be denied and the account will be locked.  Unlocking Accounts  In order to unlock your account  you must contact NY.gov, as instructed, and provide the necessary information.  By registering for a account you acknowledge and agree that :  You will abide by these Terms of Service; and the Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy for the use of NY.gov ;  You certify that all identifying personal information provided to create or access your account is accurate, and pertains solely to you as the User of the account ;  Any false statement, false certification, or false information provided in creating or using a account constitutes a criminal act which may result in the imposition of criminal sanctions ;  For the purpose of imposing criminal sanctions ,  any false statement you make in connection with creating the account ,  and each fraudulent log - in to access applications or services ,  may be treated as a separate criminal offense.  DMV reserves the right, and sole discretion, to revoke your Username and access to your account, at any time, without prior notification, in the interest of preserving the security of the system.  You are responsible for all use of your account ,  and you must protect your temporary password, Sign - In Username and Password from disclosure to any individual or entity, and must not permit the use of your account by another.  You agree to Not bypass or attempt to bypass any security controls for access to your account ;  You will keep your Username and Password in a secure place and manner ;  You will prevent disclosure of your Username and Password ;  You will prevent others from watching you enter your Username and Password ;  You will select a Username and Password that is non - obvious and difficult to guess e.g., not use your name, or the names of your spouse, children, pets, or other things that publicly identify you ;  You will sign off of the system whenever the your computer is unattended ;  You will take any action required by DMV or NY.gov to re - certify your identity, or to change your Username or Password ;  You will immediately report to DMV any known or suspected breach of system security that you become aware of."

Using the stolen data ,  the criminal can illegally obtain credit cards, set up mobile phone accounts, and more.  Take the following precautions to reduce your risk when applying for federal student aid :  Apply for federal student aid by filling out the FAFSA form at the official website or on our myStudentAid mobile app.  After completing the FAFSA form online, exit the application and close the browser ;  any cookies created during your session will be deleted automatically.  Don t tell anyone your FSA ID username or password, even if that person is helping you fill out the FAFSA form.  Review your financial aid offers and keep track of the amounts you applied for and received.  Never give personal information over the phone or internet unless you made the contact.  If you have questions about an offer of aid or about your student loan account ,  ask your college or contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center.  We securely store your information within the National Student Loan Data System NSLDS database and provide access to it when you log in to your account.  However ,  if you complete or even request a student loan application from a lender ,  you may be granting the lender permission to access your file.  Before providing personal information to an organization ,  review its privacy policy.  Keep receipts and documents for example, credit applications or offers, checks and bank statements with personal information in a safe place, and shred them when you are finished with them.  Keep your purse or wallet safe at all times; store it and other items containing personal information in a secure place at home, especially if you have roommates.  Immediately report all lost or stolen identification to the issuer e.g., the credit card company or your state s Department of Motor Vehicles and to the police, if appropriate."

Under the regulations that go into effect on July 1 , 2012, the US Department of Education calculates metrics for GE Programs each year.  These metrics include a Repayment Rate, two Debt - to - Earnings Ratios, and three student loan medians.  The 2011 GE Informational Rate information included on the downloadable spreadsheet was produced for the purpose of providing institutions with preliminary information they can use to assess their GE Programs in preparation for the official gainful employment metrics that will first be calculated in 2013.  These FY 2011 GE Informational Rates are for informational purposes only and, as such, do not invoke any regulatory requirements, sanctions, or other adverse action.  These informational rates were prepared in advance of the years in which programs that fail the debt measures will be required to provide debt warnings and may lose eligibility after failing three out of four consecutive years.  The 2011 GE Informational Rates were not calculated for a GE Program if the program had 30 or fewer former students in the relevant two - year period.  Beginning next year ,  official gainful employment debt measures will include small programs using a four - year period if that four - year period results in more than 30 former students for the GE Program.  After publishing the informational rates ,  the Department determined that the posted Median Title IV Loans amount reflected student debt information from the most recent loan award year, but did not include debt information from previous years.  On October 25 , 2012 ,  the Department posted an updated spreadsheet.  Column V reflects the median loan debt over the course of enrollment in a program.  Column W reflects the one - year median loan debt.  The Median Private Loans, Median Institutional Loans, and Median Title IV Loans were calculated for disclosure purposes and are NOT the medians that were used in the Repayment Rate or Debt - to - Earnings Ratio calculations.  IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER :  The 2011 Gainful Employment Informational Rates were prepared to provide institutions with preliminary data about the performance of their GE Programs.  The calculation of the 2011 Gainful Employment Informational Rates did not include a process for institutions to receive draft debt measures and to submit challenges, as the institutions will for official rate calculations.  For these reasons ,  the 2011 Informational Rates are not intended to form a basis for making any general or specific assumptions or determinations about specific GE Programs, or in making projections about future years' rates.

The FPRD also identifies liabilities, if any, calculated based on the findings of the program review; provides instructions for the payment of liabilities, as appropriate; notifies the institution of its right to appeal the existence and amount of any liabilities identified, as appropriate; and closes the program review, if appropriate.  The FPRD may or may not require additional action by the institution.  Future FPRDs will be posted regularly.

A third - party servicer may be an individual, a state, or a private, profit or non - profit organization that enters into a contract with an eligible institution to administer, through manual or automated processing, any aspect of the institution s participation in any federal student aid programs.  When contracting with an institution ,  a third - party servicer and/or its contractors must comply with the various Title IV requirements applicable to its servicing agreement with the school.  A third - party servicer is jointly and severally liable with the institution for any violation of Title IV requirements resulting from the functions performed by the third - party servicer.  The Title IV regulations authorize the U.S. Department of Education ED to provide oversight of third - party servicers.  As part of its oversight duties ,  Federal Student Aid FSA routinely conducts program reviews to confirm that third - party servicers and the schools that they contract with meet FSA requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability.  During program reviews ,  reviewers evaluate the third - party servicers and schools compliance with FSA requirements, assess liabilities for errors in performance, and identify actions the third - party servicers and their partner schools must take to improve future administrative capabilities.  After completing a program review ,  FSA issues a Final Program Review Determination FPRD, which is a report that includes each specific finding, the third party servicer s response, and ED s final determination.  The FPRD also  identifies liabilities, if any, calculated based on the findings of the program review ;  provides instructions for the payment of liabilities, as appropriate ;  notifies the third - party servicer of its right to appeal the existence and amount of any liabilities identified, as appropriate ;  and  closes the program review, if appropriate.  The FPRD may or may not require additional action by the third - party servicer.  Future FPRDs will be posted regularly.  Below are the FPRDs issued to third - party servicers by ED :  Commerce Bank :  issued February 2016  US Bank :  issued May 2017  Wells Fargo :  issued June 2017  Nelnet Business Solutions, Incorporated :  issued September 2017  Student Aid Administrators :  issued August 2018  Educational Management Services, Incorporated :  issued August 2018  Alliance Aid for Student Aid Processing :  issued September 2018  Higher One / Customers Bank :  issued September 2018"

Apply for student loans at your international school using the same process you use to apply for aid in the U.S.  Fill out a FAFSA form at fafsa.gov as early as possible.  The FAFSA form is available on Oct. 1 for school attendance that begins any time from July 1 of the following year through June of the year beyond that.  There is no special FAFSA form for students planning to attend international schools.  Learn how to fill out the FAFSA form.  Make sure the school you plan to attend has your FAFSA information.  International schools have the ability to access your FAFSA information electronically.  When you fill out the FAFSA form ,  list the school you plan to attend in the question about Federal School Codes.  The FAFSA site has a tool to let you search for your school s Federal School Code.  Once it s listed on your FAFSA form ,  your school will then download your data.  Find out the next steps from your chosen school.  Different schools proceed differently at this stage of the process.  Ask your school how you will get your loan money what paperwork do you need to fill out, what are the deadlines, etc.  Keep track of everything that is required of you ;  make copies of paper documents or scan them and file them safely; and meet those deadlines!  And if your parent plans to get a Direct PLUS Loan ,  he or she should keep a close eye on required documents and deadlines as well.  If you are a first - year student borrowing federal funds for the first time ,  you will have to complete entrance counseling.  This means you ll be required to read text or watch a video online, or attend an in - person presentation, in order to learn about the responsibilities of taking out a loan.  Your entrance counseling might happen before you leave the U.S. or after you arrive at your school ;  it depends on the school."

There are a few differences between the emailed confirmation and the one you ll see in the FAFSA form before exiting the application, so consider printing or saving your confirmation page before you exit.  For example ,  the emailed confirmation won t include the college graduation, retention, and transfer rates for schools you listed on your FAFSA form.

First ,  find the cost of attendance for your program on the aid offer.  If the school doesn t list the cost of attendance on the aid offer ,  ask the financial aid office for this figure.  Make sure it includes amounts you will pay to the school directly such as tuition and fees as well as other costs such as living expenses, books and supplies, and transportation.  Next ,  subtract the grant and scholarship amounts on your aid offer from the cost of attendance amount.  Also subtract any savings you have available to put toward your school costs for the school year.  The remaining amount is your net or out - of - pocket cost.  Compare the net costs for the schools you are considering.  The net cost is the amount you will have to pay out of your pocket, using earnings from work or loan funds that you borrow.

For instance ,  it s important to understand what you re being offered e.g., which items in the offer are grants and which are loans.  You also need to think about which aid to accept.  Also ,  because your aid offer might include student loans ,  it s important for you to compare the amount of debt you would be taking on at the schools you are considering.  If you find that you ll need to take out a larger amount in private loans at one school than at another ,  you should pay special attention to the terms and conditions of the private loans so you understand what your obligations would be.

Schools can choose to offer different amounts to students based on 2 factors :  Student status undergraduate, graduate, doctoral ,  and  Type of school college or professional  For example :  A school could provide $1,000 for undergraduates, $1,500 for graduate students, and $2,000 for doctoral students.  The school also could provide $1,800 for students in the school of engineering and $2,500 for students in the school of nursing.  This depends on the agreement we have with your school.  Your school s agreement with us states how much it will contribute and how much we ll match.  This amount makes up all or part of the difference between what the Post-9/11 GI Bill will pay and the unmet tuition and fees.  Here s how it works :  Let s say you re attending a public school as an out - of - state student.  The school charges $10,000 per year for in - state tuition and fees, but $16,000 per year for out - of - state tuition and fees.  We ll pay the in - state $10,000 cost under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.  But you ll need to pay the extra $6,000 for the out - of - state cost.  If you qualify for the Yellow Ribbon Program ,  you can get some or all of that extra amount paid.  We ll match the amount your school contributes to the program.  So if your school funds $3,000 of your tuition ,  we ll also pay $3,000 to your school ,  and you ll be covered for the full amount.  If your school funds $2,000 through the Yellow Ribbon Program ,  we ll also pay $2,000 to your school ,  and you ll need to pay the remaining $2,000.  Note:  Your school s agreement may also state that they ll contribute only toward degrees at certain colleges or professional schools, or only for certain degree levels like undergraduate, graduate, or doctoral degrees.  Learn more about each school s agreement  No.  You don t have to attend full - time to be in the program.  First ,  we ll determine how much the Post-9/11 GI Bill will pay.  We ll do this by subtracting any financial aid you have that s designated solely for paying tuition and fees from the total amount your school charges.  Then ,  your school s funding through the Yellow Ribbon Program and our matching contributions can cover part or all of the remaining unmet charges.  Yellow Ribbon funds may cover any mandatory required fees for your education program.  Yellow Ribbon and Post-9/11 GI Bill funds won t cover any fees that aren t mandatory, such as :  Room and board  Study abroad unless your degree program requires the study abroad course  Penalty fees like fees for late registration, returned checks, or parking fines  Yes ,  if your school still has Yellow Ribbon funds available for the per - student maximum contribution for the summer term."

The financial aid office at your college or career school will determine how much financial aid you are eligible to receive.  The financial aid staff starts by deciding upon your cost of attendance COA at that school.  They then consider your Expected Family Contribution EFC.  They subtract your EFC from your COA to determine the amount of your financial need and therefore how much need - based aid you can get.

Under all four plans ,  any remaining loan balance is forgiven if your federal student loans aren't fully repaid at the end of the repayment period.  For any income - driven repayment plan ,  periods of economic hardship deferment ,  periods of repayment under certain other repayment plans ,  and periods when your required payment is zero will count toward your total repayment period.  Whether you will have a balance left to be forgiven at the end of your repayment period  depends on a number of factors, such as how quickly your income rises and how large your income is relative to your debt.  Because of these factors ,  you may fully repay your loan before the end of your repayment period.  Your loan servicer will track your qualifying monthly payments and years of repayment and will notify you when you are getting close to the point when you would qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance.  If you re making payments under an income - driven repayment plan and also working toward loan forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF Program ,  you may qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance after you've made 10 years of qualifying payments, instead of 20 or 25 years.  Qualifying payments for the PSLF Program include payments made under any of the income - driven repayment plans."

This repayment plan saves you money over time because your monthly payments may be slightly higher than payments made under other plans, but you ll pay off your loan in the shortest time.  For this reason ,  you will pay the least amount of interest over the life of your loan.  When it comes time to repay your loans ,  you have the option to choose a repayment plan.  If you don t choose a different repayment plan ,  your loan servicer, the company that handles the billing and other services on your federal education loan, will place you on the Standard Repayment Plan."
